1. World map
To have a general overview of hotels in the client program, we can look at their locations. Here we see that mostly client hotels are located within North & Latin America and Europe. 

2. Hotel count per world region
To have more detail on wether these are preferred or non-preferred hotels, we plot the pref vs non-pref hotels per region. Here we see that while Americas and Europe have the most number of hotels, they have the least number of preferred hotels. This means that the client preferred hotel program can be largely improved in these reagons and more preferred hotels can be contracted here. Africa, Asia and Middle East on the opposite have around 40% of preferred hotels, so these regions are doing better; however there's still room for improvement as the optimal ratio of preferred hotels should be between 60-70%.

3. Spend & roomnights per region
When looking at spend & roomnights per region, we see clearly that Americas & Europe all are in top 3. So this really means, that the most bookings are going to these regions and therefore the client should work on contracting more hotels within these regions.

4. Average Booked Rate vs Roomnights
When looking at average booked rates vs roomnights, we don't see a clear correlation between number of nights booked and the average rate. We would expect that the higher the number of nights, the lower the rate, but this is not the case. The reason is that it depends on the hotel location & hotel category, the latter is something that's missing in our dataset and would need to be provided for further investigation. 
We also run into two outliers that seem to have exteemely high number of roomnights booked compared to all other hotels.
When we take a closer look at these two hotels, both are situated in Latin America, one in Sao Paulo, Brazil and the other in Araras, Brazil. Both hotels are preferred and are clearly top hotels booked by the client; however their average booked rate is clearly quite high. This is probably due to the fact that both are quite expensive cities and both hotels are of higher tier.

5. Rates top chains
When looking at rates by hotel chain, we first find the 5 top chains, which are Hilton, Accor, Intercontinental, Choice & Marriott. 
Lowest average booked rate is with Intercontinental and Marriott chain hotels. While negotiated client rate is lowest with Choice Hotels and Intercontinental. However, the agreement rates are higher than ABR for all top chains, which shows that there's a lot of room for improving the client negotiated rate. 

Conclusion:
The main takeaway we saw is that the client has a room for improvement for all regions in terms of new hotels to add to their preferred program, and the most important regions to concentrate on are Americas & Europe as they have extremely low number of preferred hotels while a lot of money is spent booking hotels there. 
Negotiations with preferred hotels should also be improved, so that the preferred room prices would get lower as the number of nights booked increases. Also as seen, the average booked rates are often below the preferred prices, so clearly hotels can lower the rate that's being negotiated for the client. These are the two actions that should be taken.
