A great new source is the [Google dataset search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch).\n",
    "- Perform Preliminary Analysis: use functions like `describe` to help guide you to the correct insight and data visualization.\n",
    "- Using your data, create a minimum of one scatter plot, one histogram, one box plot and one bar graph (you can add more than one visualization of each type of you choose). Graphs should contain the proper labeling of the x and y axis when appropriate as well as a title for the graph.\n",
    "- Explain what insight or information is inferred from these visualizations. The explanation should be in the notebook in markdown cells.\n",
    "- Create a data folder containing your data set."
