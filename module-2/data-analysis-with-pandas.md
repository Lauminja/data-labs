# Guided Project: Data Analysis with Pandas

## Overview

The goal of this project is for you to perform exploratory data analysis on a real world dataset of your choice using Pandas. 

<b>You will be working individually for this project</b>, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping you as you go. 

---

## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:
 - You will select a real world dataset.
 - You will create a jupyter notebook to perform your analysis the dataset.
 - You should incorporate at least three elements from the topics covered in this chapter in your analysis of the dataset.
 - You should include your thoughts and conclusions from the analysis in markdown cells in the notebook.
 
## Necessary Deliverables

The following deliverables should be pushed to your Github repo for this chapter.

- <b>A jupyter notebook</b> containing your analysis and the code you used to obtain this analysis.
- <b>A data folder</b> containing the 

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

* Here are a few options of games of chance:
    * [Blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack#Basic_strategy)
    * [Roulette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roulette#Bet_odds_table)
    * [Craps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craps#Bet_odds_and_summary)
* Compute the number of possible ways to get any outcome
* Compute the number of ways to obtain a particular outcome
* Divide the two and find the probability of each outcome
* Explain how likely this outcome is using markdown comments in your notebook

## Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you incorporate domain knowledge or unique perspective into your analysis.

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    **Score**|**Expectations**
    -----|-----
    0|Does not meet expectations
    1|Meets expectations, good job!
    2|Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!

This will be useful as an overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are described in the specs above__, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

## Presentation Guideline and Criteria

### Format

* Presentation Time: 4 minutes
* Q & A: 3 minutes
* **Total Time:** 7 minutes

### Attire

* DRESS TO IMPRESS: [Smart casual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_casual) would be great

### Outputs

* Present your findings using the jupyter notebook.
* The presentation and demo will be executed on a class computer (instead of your own).
* Be prepared to explain your entire notebook and thought process.

### Things you might want to talk about

* Short presentation of yourself:
	* Who are you?
	* What you hope to get from this course
  * __Note: we are getting you ready for final presentation!__
* Introduction
  * The game you chose
  * What did you learn about games of chance from this presentation?
  * The most important thing you learned.
* The code
    * Be prepared to explain your code as well as markdown comments 
* The computations
    * Explain the outcomes you chose and their probabilities.
* Your insight
    * Explain what insight you derived from your calculations and what this tells us about the game.
